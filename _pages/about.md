Rafael Oliveira is a Senior Research Scientist at Data61, part of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia. He is currently working with the Statistical Machine Learning (StatML) group, led by Dr. Petra Kuhnert, under the supervision of Dr. Edwin Bonilla.


Biography
---
Rafael Oliveira was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at [the University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au), Australia.
There, he worked with multiple teams, including the ARC training centre in Data Analytics for Resources and Environments
([DARE](https://darecentre.org.au/)) under the supervision of
[Prof. Sally Cripps](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/sally-cripps.html)
and the [Brain and Mind Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/brain-mind/) in a
[project](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/07/08/ai-medical-research-projects-receive--7-1-million-funding.html)
led by [Dr. Frank Iorfino](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/frank-iorfino.html). Rafael received his PhD from the University of Sydney in 2019, where he studied under the supervision of
 [Prof. Fabio Ramos](http://web.it.usyd.edu.au/~framos/Home.html).
 He also holds a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from the 
 Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br)), Brazil.

Research interests
---
Rafael's current research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for problems stemming from 
planning under uncertainty and Bayesian inference. In particular, he has been working with Bayesian optimisation, 
Gaussian processes, kernel methods and Bayesian inference algorithms. In terms of applications, his
work has been addressing problems in robotics, experimental design and mental health research.
More detailed information is available at his [publications](publications.md) page.

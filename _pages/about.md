Rafael Oliveira is a Senior Research Scientist at [Data61](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/data61), the data and digital specialist arm of Australia's national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/)). He is a member of the Decisions and Statistical Learning team, led by [Dr. Daniel Steinberg](https://dsteinberg.github.io/index.html), and is working under the supervision of [Dr. Edwin Bonilla](https://ebonilla.github.io/).


Biography
---
Rafael Oliveira was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at [the University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au), Australia.
There, he worked with multiple teams, including the ARC training centre in Data Analytics for Resources and Environments
([DARE](https://darecentre.org.au/)) under the supervision of
[Prof. Sally Cripps](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/sally-cripps.html)
and the [Brain and Mind Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/brain-mind/) in a
[project](https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/07/08/ai-medical-research-projects-receive--7-1-million-funding.html)
led by [Dr. Frank Iorfino](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/frank-iorfino.html). Rafael received his PhD from the University of Sydney in 2019, where he studied under the supervision of
 [Prof. Fabio Ramos](http://web.it.usyd.edu.au/~framos/Home.html).
 He also holds a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from the 
 Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br)), Brazil.

Research interests
---
Rafael's research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for problems stemming from 
planning under uncertainty and Bayesian inference. He has been developing Bayesian optimisation and approximate Bayesian inference algorithms to tackle complex problems where data is potentially scarce and costly obtain. His work has been applied to problems in robotics, experimental design and mental health research.
